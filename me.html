        <h3>More About Me</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>First of all, I love my friends and family.</p>
            <p>I also do whatever I can to get the best grades possible</p>
            <p>As you probably already know by now, I love basketball</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>What College Do I Want to Attend? </h3>

        <p>When I finish my current Highschool of Hoffman Estates, I want to move on to Oregon University.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h4> Why Oregon University? </h4>

        <p> Oregon University is like a dream school to me.</p>
        <p> I have family that live in Portland as well.</p>
        <p> Therefore my favorite sports teams include the oregon Ducks, Trailblazers, and none other than the Bulls.</p>
