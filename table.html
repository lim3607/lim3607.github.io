    <h4>What Got Me Started?</h4>

    <ul>
        <p>As a young kid parents wanted to put their kids in as many sports as possible.</p>
        <p>Some of those sports consisted of baseball, soccer, basketball, and football.</p>
        <p>Eventually I had to pick one sport and basketball seemed to stick me.</p>
